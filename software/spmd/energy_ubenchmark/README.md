Energy micro-benchmarks

- Type "make all -j8" to run simulations and generate "vanilla.saif".
- The start and end of SAIF generation is triggered by "bsg_asm_saif_start" and "bsg_asm_saif_end".


Acknowledgement
- Thanks to the Batten Research Group, we extend their methodology with these micro benchmarks.
