Here are the steps for adding an accelerator:

1. Clone and rename the file/module bsg_manycore_accel_default.v for
   your new kind of accelerators.

2. Create your own version of bsg_manycore_hetero_socket.v that 
   contains the mapping between accelerator type (an 8 bit value) 
   and the module name, if you are adding new types of accelerators. 
   type 0 is reserved for the vscale general purpose core
   type 1 is reserved for the bsg_manycore_accel_default (pass-thru) accelerator

3. Update the Makefile
   a. modify bsg_tiles_X and bsg_tiles_Y according to the new size
      of your system.
   b. Update BSG_HETERO_TYPE_VEC with types of accelerators you want at each
      tile. There are 8 bits per tile in the vector, with tile 0 being
      the right most bits in the file. You may to update the size of the vector.

4. Update hello.c to program the outgoing address and Y/X coordinates
   of the accelerators. In the current example, it chains them together
   linearly, and then back to the host core. For communication with the
   core, you might want to modify the logic in the accelerator to
   increment the address so that you can write an array of addresses
    rather than pile all memory requests on top of each other.
   
   (Later you may use the ARM core to do this function instead.)
