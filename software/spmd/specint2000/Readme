SPECInt2000 Benchamarks on Manycore
===================================

- Benchmarks imported from RAW's greenlight repo
- `rawlib/`: Since `greenlight` was originally written for raw, it uses 
						 some raw library functions to run spec benchamrks. This folder
						 contains manycore versions of some raw library functions.
- `Makefile.<BenChMaRK>`: Makefile to run `<BenChMaRK>`
