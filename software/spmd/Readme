Manycore regression
===================

RTL regression testing of the manycore.

make [bsg_tiles_X=<x>] [bsg_tiles_Y=<y>] [COVERAGE=VCS] 

- bsg_tiles_X
    Can be used to specify the number of rows to be instantiated. Default
    value provided in individual testcases.
- bsg_tiles_Y 
    Can be used to specify the number of columns to be instantiated. Default
    value provided in individual testcases.
- COVERAGE=VCS
    RTL Coverage analysis using VCS. Coverage reports generated using
    Unified Coverage Genrator (URG). Default configuration used for
    the coverage analysis is 4x4. This will be overwritten only when
    above dimension variables are explicitly set.

Note: 
    Current design is only tested for x<=4, y<=4 and dimensions mentioned in
    individual testcases.
